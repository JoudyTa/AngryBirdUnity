# AngryBirdUnity
I played a cool video game that was built using C# and Unity. The game is all about birds that get thrown at either walls or enemies. The creators used some fancy algorithms like GJK, Hash Mapping, and Sphere to detect when the birds collided with something. They also used EDA to figure out exactly where the collision happened and VHACD to help with concavity. After the collision, the bird's reflection depends on what it hits. Sometimes it's an explosion, other times the bird gets deformed or the shape changes. If the object it hits has iron properties, the shape can even fluctuate. These reflections all follow the laws of physics, which makes them feel super realistic.
